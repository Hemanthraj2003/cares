# CARES â€” Phase 01 Technical Debt

This file records features intentionally deferred from the Phase 01 MVP to keep delivery fast. Implement these later when there is time for polishing and additional capabilities.

## Current MVP scope

- The Phase 01 MVP will include a minimal TUI built with Bubble Tea that displays CPU and memory metrics.

## Deferred Features (keep for later)

- Advanced executor options
  - Configurable Docker run flags (network, mounts, resource limits)
  - Image signature/validation before run
  - Image pull policy and registry configuration
- Robust orchestration primitives
  - Channel-based metrics delivery and non-blocking collectors
  - Scheduler logic for multiple tasks
- Observability and monitoring
  - Prometheus metrics exposition
  - Structured logging with levels (debug/info/warn/error)
- Testing and CI
  - Integration tests for executor with a local Docker daemon
  - Unit tests with mocks for executor and metrics
  - CI pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions)
- Security
  - TLS for any remote communication
  - Authentication/authorization for function upload/execute
  - Sandboxing and stricter container isolation
- Configuration
  - YAML/JSON config file support
  - Environment-based overrides and validation

## Notes

The minimal TUI will be implemented as part of Phase 01 MVP; all other items remain recorded here for Phase 2.
